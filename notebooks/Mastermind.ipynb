    "Have you ever played [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))? This is a game where one player, a *codemaker*, has to choose a secret combination of colored pegs and then get someone else, a *codebreaker* to make guesses. The codemaker answers each guess attempt of the codebreaker by indicating *only* the number of well placed colors and the number of correct but misplaced colors.\n",
